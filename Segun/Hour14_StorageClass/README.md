===========================The Readme file=====================

```
	In this Readme file, we explore the core concept of 
scope and storage clase, where we figured out we had 4 major
scope, which are;
```
+ Program scope {Global variable}
+ Function scope 
+ Block  Scope
+ File scope

```
	I also figured out that a storage class is made up from 
the combination of the spatial and temporal regions; which includes scope 
and duration. We figured out we had 4 specifiers and 2 major modifiers,which
are;
```
+ Static Specifiers
+ Auto Specifiers
+ register specifier
+ Extern specifier

## 2 major modifiers are;

+ Const modifiers
+ Volatility modifiers
